                        In order to become a FAF student, you have to first
                        apply to any of the specialities of the CIM Faculty
                        (Computers, Informatics and Microelectronics) of the
                        Technical University of Moldova. Descriptions of the
                        application process and required documents are usually
                        available on the university's official website <a
                            href="http://utm.md/" target="blank">www.utm.md</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During your first week of studies at the CIM Faculty,
                        you have to apply for FAF by writing a request (cerere)
                        to the faculty’s dean, in which you show your intention
                        to participate at the competition organized by the
                        Anglophone Department. Usually, during this week, there
                        are some students from a higher FAF year of studies in
                        the hall of the FCIM building, to whom you can approach
                        with questions on how life as a FAF student is, or ask
                        how you can write the request to become a FAF student.
                        If you don’t see them in hall, then go to the 213A room,
                        where it is most likely you will find someone who can
                        help you.

                    <p>
                        Exams are not that hard to pass and you have nothing to
                        lose if you try. For example, at the English exam you
                        have to write down a couple of sentences and put the
                        verbs in the brackets in their correct form and for the
                        math part you have a small number of problems highly
                        resembling the ones you passed in June. The big plus is
                        that the tests don’t surpass the difficulty of the
                        Baccalaureate exams. If you are good at math, but have
                        troubles with English, come and take the tests, we are
                        sure you have a high chance of getting through.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After the exams (usually next monday), come to the
                        university and go up to the 2nd floor to find yourself
                        in the list of FAF students. If you do (and we are sure
                        that will be the case), you have to write one more
                        request where you ask to be transferred in the FAF
                        group.

                    <p>
                        Those few years at the university you will pass them as
                        a whole with you colleagues. And your personal progress
                        will mostly depend on the one of your group’s.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That is why FAF has the most favourable development
                        environment: the majority of it’s students are highly
                        motivated and with a huge knowledge background and the
                        group’s spirit is the key element that brings
                        constructive competition inside the team, along with an
                        ability the industry strives for the most: teamwork.

                    <p>
                        If you feel like a motivated person, or you know that
                        you are one of those who choose to perfect themselves,
                        then this is where you should be - Anglophone
                        Department.
